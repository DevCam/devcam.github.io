We have all the social networks that we will ever need, and then some.

## Preface

Although I would not consider this to be a particularly controversial statement, there is a large spectrum of opinions that range from having absolutely no social networks to being an early adopter of all social apps. I like to thing that I lie somewhere in the middle.

Almost every sentence in this document should be prefaced with *in my opinion* or *to me* for brevity reasons this prefix will be omitted.

Social networks should be used with great caution. They are very useful to superficially keep in touch with acquaintances and to have a general and filtered idea about their lives at the cost of our private information.

It escapes the subject of this post if Facebook, Instagram, Twitter *et al.* have a net positive impact in our world. One thing is for certain: **They should never become a hard requirement to get a job.**

## Why no LinkedIn

I refuse to open a LinkedIn profile due the following (perhaps contentious) reasons, in no order in particular – 

-	It is an additional social network to maintain. [^1]
-	It is becoming insidiously prevalent in tech jobs. [^1]
-	It is a private Microsoft-owned product. [^2]
-	We already have GitHub as a *de-facto* hard requirement. [^3]

## To briefly clarify

>  It is an additional social network to maintain.
>  It is becoming insidiously prevalent in tech jobs.

[^1]: As a professional social network, it must be carefully maintained and constantly checked.

The assumption has become that a developer has a LinkedIn profile, so much so that recruiting forms add a discrete field for applicants to provide it. I suspect that it provides employees an easy-all-in-one way to review the professional trajectory of a given candidate and filter them as appropriate. I’d argue that’s the purpose of redacting a CV, and it should not be superseded by LinkedIn. 

>  It is a private Microsoft-owned product.

[^2]: I have no issues with Microsoft as a corporation, in fact I’d consider `c#` my favorite language to use after `ruby`, and `.NET-core` is my favorite framework bar none.

But who gave them the keys? They will rightfully use LinkedIn to generate revenue, and we are the product. Perhaps it's a win-win kind of deal, but I'd rather not partake, and I certainly don't want to see it become a requirement.

>  We already have GitHub as a *de-facto* hard requirement.

[^3]: It is already a safe assumption that a developer has a GitHub account, must we really add yet another social media account to the mix?

## TL; DR

LinkedIn provides a considerable amount of value both to recruiters and future employees (otherwise it surely would not be as popular). It is a weird hill to die one, but every day we give up a little more of our privacy for conveniences’ sake and spend more of our day creating the perfect personal profile. Facebook, Instagram and GitHub are necessary evils, I’ve chosen not to add another element to the list.
