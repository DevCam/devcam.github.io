Where mistakes and inaccuracies do not matter because the winner is the player that manages to blunder the least! This results in very exciting chess where all three results are always possible!Set UpConsider the following game, full of blunders and missed opportunities. 1.c4 e6 2. Nc3 Nf6 3.

Rf1after Rf1 I’d say both sides stand badly, but black is clearly betterBoth sides stand badly, but white is clearly worstSince the purpose of Rf1 was to move it out of the black queens’ way and attack the knight, my opponent wisely decided to maneuver it to a better square with Nf5, I decided that I was completely lost anyways and might as well get some sort of counterplay with Qc2. Engine recommends trading my bishop for the knight but since we are both low rated, chances are I still might find some way to win.Blunder Time After thinking for 9 seconds my opponent found the only move that loses the game.I don’t blame him at all, since in a rapid game with low time I’d play Ng3+?? almost immediately. I expertly played the only legal move Kg1 and now white is +3. Qc7+ is now too strong. The best try for black is to retreat the knight back to f5. But that would defeat the purpose of Ng3+ so my opponent decided to capture my rook. I’d hazard a guess he calculated that my king would capture back and he was perfectly fine. We instead play the crushing Qc7+Consecuences As engines like to say: checkmate is now unavoidableI usually take issue with that evaluation. Checkmate is now unavoidable with correct play and as I’ve established: this is very rarely the case. Here we need not be Kasparov to see that at the very least black is losing absolutely every piece in his back rank.I evidently had not calculated nor seen that Qc7+ was mate in 9, I just wanted some counterplay, and counterplay I got. Since every move was check, finding the mate was easy.I got very lucky that the most obvious and attractive move for my opponent was the losing move, and that he underestimated or miscalculated Qc7+ Game Information devcam (1859) v.

I like to thing that I lie somewhere in the middle. Warning! This piece contains highly opinionated content! Most of it can’t be backed up with credible sources.Almost every sentence in this document should be prefaced with in my opinion or to me for brevity reasons this prefix will be omitted.Social networks should be used with great caution. They are very useful to superficially keep in touch with acquaintances and to have a general and filtered idea about their lives at the cost of our private information.It escapes the subject of this post if Facebook, Instagram, Twitter et al. have a net positive impact in our world. One thing is for certain: They should never become a hard requirement to get a job.Why no LinkedInI refuse to open a LinkedIn profile due the following (perhaps contentious) reasons, in no order in particular – It is an additional social network to maintain. 1 It is becoming insidiously prevalent in tech jobs. 1 It is a private Microsoft-owned product. 2 We already have GitHub as a de-facto hard requirement. 3To briefly clarify It is an additional social network to maintain. It is becoming insidiously prevalent in tech jobs.The assumption has become that a developer has a LinkedIn profile, so much so that recruiting forms add a discrete field for applicants to provide it. I suspect that it provides employees an easy-all-in-one way to review the professional trajectory of a given candidate and filter them as appropriate. I’d argue that’s the purpose of redacting a CV, and it should not be superseded by LinkedIn. It is a private Microsoft-owned product.But who gave them the keys? They will rightfully use LinkedIn to generate revenue, and we are the product. Perhaps it’s a win-win kind of deal, but I’d rather not partake, and I certainly don’t want to see it become a requirement. We already have GitHub as a de-facto hard requirement.TL; DRLinkedIn provides a considerable amount of value both to recruiters and future employees (otherwise it surely would not be as popular). It is a weird hill to die one, but every day we give up a little more of our privacy for conveniences’ sake and spend more of our day creating the perfect personal profile. Facebook, Instagram and GitHub are necessary evils, I’ve chosen not to add another element to the list. As a professional social network, it must be carefully maintained and constantly checked. &#8617; &#8617;2 I have no issues with Microsoft as a corporation, in fact I’d consider c# my favorite language to use after ruby, and .NET-core is my favorite framework bar none. &#8617; It is already a safe assumption that a developer has a GitHub account, must we really add yet another social media account to the mix? &#8617; " } ]
